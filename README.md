What is it?

SKOOL is a program that allows students to view klasses along respective ratings from other users just like you. Choosing a klass can be difficult, but knowing a few helpful things such as a klass rating might help you make your life a little easier.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Hello, and welcome to SKOOL! We're excited to have you be part of our test user group. First, you'll need to fork this repository from your GitHub account and clone it to your local machine. Once this is done, please cd into that directory and open the file with your text editor. If set u correctly, once inside the directory, type "code ." to open it up. Before running this program, please ensure to run "bundle install" from your terminal to ensure that you have the proper gem dependencies. The following gems are required in your Gemfile.rb in order to circumvent trouble.

Once this is complete, run the program by typing "ruby bin/run.rb" from inside your terminal.
